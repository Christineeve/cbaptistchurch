    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our belief that the Scripture contained in the Holy Bible are the words of God, we cannot sanction, approve, support or promote in any way adultery, fornication (a sexual relationship between an unmarried man and woman; i.e. "living together"), pornography, pedophilia, polygamy, bestiality or homosexual unions. (Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:26-27; I Corinthians 5:9)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a result of our beliefs in the Holy Scriptures, as described previously, it is our policy that the facilities and grounds of this church, our members, our teachers, our leaders and our staff, may not be used or participate in any ceremony that in any way approves, celebrates, supports or allows same-sex union or a polygamist union or any other union which, in judgment of the church based on the Holy Scriptures, is inconsistent with our beliefs.
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We believe that in order to preserve the function and integrity of the Church as the local Body of Christ, and to provide a Biblical role model to the Church members and the community, it is imperative that all persons employed by the Church in any capacity, or who serve as volunteers, should abide by and agree to this Statement on Marriage and Sexuality and conduct themselves accordingly.
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>The Scriptures – The scriptures of the Old and New Testaments were given by the inspiration of God, and are the only sufficient, certain and authoritative rule of all saving knowledge, faith and obedience.  (Jeremiah 30:2, II Timothy 3:16)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>God – There is but one God, the Maker, Preserver and Ruler of all things, having in and of Himself all perfection, and being infinite in them all; and to Him all creatures owe the highest love, reverence and obedience.  (Genesis 1, Exodus 20:3, Psalm 41:13)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>Trinity – God is revealed to us as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, each with distinct personal attributes, but without division of Nature, essence of being.  (I John 5:6, 7)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>Providence – God from eternity decrees or permits all things that come to pass, and perpetually upholds, directs and governs the author or approver of sin nor to destroy the free will and responsibility of intelligent creatures.  (I Corinthians 2:9)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>Freeness of Salvation – The blessings of salvation are made free to all believers.  There is nothing, which prevents the salvation of the worst sinner on earth except his own voluntary rejection of the Gospel.  (Romans 10:9-10, 6:23; Ephesians 2:8-9)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>Fall of Man – God created man in His own image and free from sin, but through the temptation of Satan, he transgressed the command of God and fell from his original state of righteousness.  In consequence of this, all mankind are sinners, not by constraint but choice, and are transgressors of the law.  (Genesis 3:15, Romans 3:23)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>The Mediator – Jesus Christ, the Son of God, having taken upon Himself human nature, but void of sin, died on the cross for the salvation of sinners.  It is He who is qualified to make intercession for his people.  (I Timothy 2:5)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>Regeneration – A change of heart wrought by God through the Holy Spirit to a believer in the Son of God.  (Romans 6:3-23, II Corinthians 5:17)
</p><p>
</p><p>Repentance – Having been made conscious by the Holy spirit of the evil of sin one humbles himself, with Godly sorrow, destination of sin, and self-abhorrence, and determines to walk with God so as to please Him in all things.  (Psalm 51:1-4)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>Faith – Saving faith is the belief, on God’s authority, of whatsoever is revealed in His Word concerning Christ.  It is wrought in the heart by the Holy Spirit, and is accompanied by all other saving graces, and leads to a life of holiness.  (John 3:16, Acts 16:31, I Peter 2:6-10)
</p><p>
</p><p>Justification - God’s full acquittal from all sin, not upon any merits of the sinner, but on account of the obedience and to all Christ’s commands.  (Romans 1:16, 17, Romans 3:24-26)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>Sanctification – A progressive pressing after a holy and heavenly life through a supply of divine strength and in cordial obedience to all Christ’s commands.  (Romans 8:3, 4, Ephesians 1:4)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>Perseverance of the Saints – Those whom God hath accepted and sanctified by His Spirit, will never totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace, but shall certainly persevere to the end; and though they may fall, through neglect and temptation into sin, whereby they grieve the Spirit, impair their graces and comforts, bring reproach on the church, and temporal judgements on themselves yet they shall be renewed again into repentance and be kept by the power of God through faith and unto salvation.  (John 10:28, I John 5:13)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>The Church – The Lord Jesus is the head of the Church, which is composed of all His true believers, and in Him is vested supremely all power for its government.  According to His commandment, Christians are to associate themselves into particular societies of churches, to which He has given need authority for the administration of affairs.  The regular officers of a church are Bishops or Elders (Pastors) and Deacons.  (Matthew 16:18, I Corinthians 3:9, Ephesians 4:11-12, I Timothy 3:1-13)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>Baptism – An ordinance of the Lord Jesus, obligatory upon every believer, wherein he is immersed in water In the name of the Father, son and
</p><p>
</p><p>Holy Spirit, as a sign of his fellowship with death, burial and resurrection of Christ, of remission of sins, and of his giving himself up to God, to live and walk in newness of life.  I is prerequisite to church fellowship, and to participation in the Lord’s Supper.  (Matthew 28:19, 20, Romans 6:3, 4)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>The Lord’s Supper – An ordinance of Jesus Christ, to be administered with the elements of bread and the juice of the vine, to be observed by His churches until He comes again.  It is in no sense a sacrament but is a memorial to His death and a renewal of communion with Him.  (I
</p><p>
</p><p>Corinthians 11:20-34)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>The Lord’s Day – A Christian institution or regular observance, and should be employed in exercises of worship and spiritual devotion both public and private, resting from worldly employments and amusements; works of necessity and mercy only excepted.  (Genesis 2:2-3)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>The Righteous and the Wicked – There is a radical and essential difference between the righteous and wicked.  Those only who are justified through the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and sanctified by The Holy Spirit are truly righteous in His sight.  Those who continue in impenitence and unbelief are in His sight wicked and under condemnation. 
</p><p>This distinction between the righteous and the wicked holds in and after death, and will be made manifest at the judgment when final and everlasting awards are made to all men (Psalm 1:1-6, Malachi 3:18, Romans 2:7-10)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>The Resurrection – The Scriptures clearly teach that Jesus arose from the dead.  His grave was emptied of its contents.  He appeared to the disciples after His resurrection in many convincing manifestations.  He now exists in His glorified body at God’s right hand.  There will be a resurrection of the righteous and the wicked.  The bodies of the righteous will conform to the glorious spiritual body of Jesus.  (Luke 23, 24, Romans 8:10, 11, Luke 20:27, 28, I Corinthians 15:22-32)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>The Return of the Lord – The New Testament teaches in many places the visible and personal return of Jesus to this earth.  The time of His coming is not revealed.  It is the duty of all believers to live in readiness for His coming and by diligence in good works to make manifest to all men the reality and power of their hope in Christ.  (Matthew 24:36, I Thessalonians 4:13-18)
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>The Judgment – God hath appointed a day, wherein He will judge the world by Jesus Christ.  The final announcement of destinies of men shall be made – the wicked going into everlasting punishment and the righteous into everlasting life.  Also, everyone shall receive according to his deeds.  (Hebrew 9:27, Revelation 20:11-15)
</p><p>
</p><p>Election – We believe in election to the extent that God employs some, as agents in carrying out His holy will in the world.  It is the eternal purpose of God but is in no way inconsistent with the free agency of man (John 15:16, Ephesians 1:4, II Thessalonians 2:13)</p></div>
